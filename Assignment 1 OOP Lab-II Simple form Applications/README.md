Assalamu alikum sir.

I intend here to describe my "Assignment 1 OOP Lab-II Simple form Applications".

# Here are two folders - "StudentProfile" and "Others".

## "StudentProfile" is the folder of my entire project made in VS. In this folder the signifiant files are -

Form1.cs

Form1.Designer.cs

Form1.resx

Form2.cs

Form2.Designer.cs

Form2.resx



## Another foler named "Others" contains the files that are not created in VS but requred to create and maintain the project.
This folder contans the lab report, some screenshots, teacher's instruction and sample image.
